# Fleet

**Fleet** is High-Level API for distributed training in PaddlePaddle. The name of **Fleet** means that a large crowd of ships working together to finish a large scale job. The design of Fleet makes a trade-off between easy-to-use and algorithmic extensibility and is highly efficient. First, a user can shift from local machine paddlepaddle code to distributed code  **within ten lines of code**. Second, different algorithms can be easily defined through **distributed strategy**  through Fleet API. Finally, distributed training is **extremely fast** with Fleet and just enjoy it.

**Note: all the examples here should be replicated from develop branch of Paddle**

``` bash
pip install paddlepaddle
```

## A Distributed Resnet50 Training Example

``` python

...    

```

## Fleet is Highly Efficient

Deep neural networks training with Fleet API is highly efficient in PaddlePaddle. We benchmark serveral standard models here.

### Parameter Server Training

Parameter server training benchmark is performed on click through rate estimation task on [Criteo Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge/data) and Semantic Representation Learning on [One-billion word Dataset](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub41880). Details of hardware and software information for this benchmark can be found in [parameter server benchmark](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Fleet/tree/develop/benchmark/ps).
